# SolidWorks Practice Exercises Collection


## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SolidWorks modeling exercises designed to develop and refine CAD skills across various mechanical design scenarios. The exercises cover a wide range of modeling techniques, from basic part creation to advanced surfacing and assembly constraints.

This collection serves as both a learning resource for SolidWorks beginners and a reference library for experienced users to practice specific modeling techniques. Each exercise demonstrates different aspects of mechanical design, geometric constraints, and parametric modeling principles.
